** CREATE - User can create new and view existing files. The user cannot edit or delete existing files.,
"** EDIT - User has access to create new, view existing, and edit existing files. The user cannot delete existing files.",
"** FULL - User has access to create new files and view, edit, and delete existing files. ",

        Note:,This worksheet does not detail how different access levels affect each permission usage; it simply lists the minimum level required.
,"Some permissions fit an access model where each successive level (view, create, edit, full) provides increased usage."
,"Note that some permissions do not fit exactly into this model.  For some permissions, only the minimum view level is required, and "
,other levels do not provide any additional capabilities.

What is in the Permissions Usage List worksheet?,

"***  The minimum selectable level (view, create, edit, or full) for each permission.",
"***  The minimum system level (view, create, edit, or full) contains the minimum valid level selectable for a permission in the system. This level takes precedence in case it differs from the level in the Minimum Selectable Level column.",
